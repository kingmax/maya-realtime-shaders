## Info

This repository is a collection of CGFX, HLSL, and DX11 shaders for the Maya viewport that I've worked on over the years. Some are quite complex and useful - some, well, *I didn't really know what I was doing*.

These are quite old and I haven't looked at them in years.  I've posted them here for the use and enjoyment of everyone.

## Useage

These were all designed to be loaded in Maya by the nodes cgfxShader, hlslShader, and dx11Shader, as appropriate. They require certain combinations of viewport and viewport rendering engine settings depending on how the different nodes work and may not work in all versions of Maya.
